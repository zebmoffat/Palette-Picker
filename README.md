# Palette-Picker

Palette Picker is a React application that uses The Color API (https://www.thecolorapi.com/) to generate a palette. Palettes are generated from a user-chosen theme and can be generated randomly or with a suggested color by the user. Palettes are great for inspiration, UI themes, and much more.

Palette Picker can be used online at https://zebmoffat.github.io/Palette-Picker/ or installed locally.
